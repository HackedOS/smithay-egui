Integration of [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui) into [`smithay`](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/).
Mainly intended for debug interfaces.

Currently work-in-progress, but the basics are mostly working.

`smithay-egui` currently depends on a git-version of `smithay`.
A first version will likely be published on crates.io once smithay 0.4 is released.

For an example of how to use smithay-egui see [here](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay-egui/blob/main/examples/integration.rs).
